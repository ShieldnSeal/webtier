              Jonathan Heiniemi (pronounced hay-neh-me), The founder of Shield N Seal, began the company humbly, in his garage. Jon grew up in Honolulu, HI, and spent summers at his father’s farm in Northern MN. He was raised to appreciate fresh, home-grown foods, gardening, and great home-cooked meals. He saw a lack of proper packaging for home gardeners, preppers, hunters, chefs and food enthusiasts. In 2011, he began to design products that addressed the issues he saw in sustainable food conservation.  It was Jon’s desire to bring a bigger, better, stronger, and more cost effective food sealing product to the market. He enlisted the help of his Father, Larry, a retired professional wrestler, that some of you might know better as ‘Lars Anderson’.

              Their family owned and operated business, based in Nevada City, CA, enables Jon and Larry to preserve the wholesome foods they love, and to offer the same to goodness to your family.
              All of our sealer machines are built to withstand repeated use, are repairable, and come with a maintenance kit. We have tested all of our plastics to ensure that are food safe, BPA free, and without any other harsh chemicals that might leach into your food.  The Bags and rolls are 5mm thick, which is heavier that most other bags on the market, and they come in a variety of styles to suit a variety of needs.
              Jonathan continues to innovate, always working to create more effective, cost efficient, and sustainable solutions. The entire team is committed to creating a line of products  that will assure quality and safety in preservation.
